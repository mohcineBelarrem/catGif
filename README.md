# Random Cat Gif App

![alt text](http://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=src&type=gif)

Gif API: 
http://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=src&type=gif

Text API:
http://loripsum.net/api

### Assignment:

1. Create a tableview inside a UITabBarController which shows a list of a 100 (hundred)  random cat gifs. The mentioned API link wil show a random gif everytime itâ€™s loaded. The API supports different formats and requests, feel free to customize the request to your needs.

2. Once a cell gets pressed it should show the same gif in a new screen with text from the Lorem Ipsum API.


### Result:

The use of UITabBarController Controller didn't seem logical to me since there would be only one tab showing the table view. I used a navigationController instead to show the detail.
